# 2048_Solver
2048 game coded up plus an automatic solver based off of my own way of playing 2048.

## Why I made this
I really like playing 2048, and so I thought it would be cool if I could code it up, and also model an algorithm based off of how I play the game as well. As of Febuary 4th, 2026, the highest score I've gotten in 2048 is 103,668, with a highest tile of 8196, and so I am curious if this version can actually end up beating me.
